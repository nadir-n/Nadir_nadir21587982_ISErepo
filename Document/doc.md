## Introduction
The software company aims to develop tools for numerology analysis, focusing on two scenarios:

For a given birthday, determine the Life Path Number, identify the Lucky Colour, and check if it's a master number. Also, compare Life Path Numbers if two birthdays are provided. The calculation methods and Lucky Colours specified in Figure 1 will be used.
Determine the generation a person belongs to based on their birthday, using the generations outlined in Figure 2. Only birthdays between 1901 and 2024 are considered, accepting input in both numeric and month name formats.
