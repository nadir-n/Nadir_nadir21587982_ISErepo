## Introduction
The software company aims to develop tools for numerology analysis, focusing on two scenarios:

For a given birthday, determine the Life Path Number, identify the Lucky Colour, and check if it's a master number. Also, compare Life Path Numbers if two birthdays are provided. 

Determine the generation a person belongs to based on their birthday. Only birthdays between 1901 and 2024 are considered, accepting input in both numeric and month name formats.
